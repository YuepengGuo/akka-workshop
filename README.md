### Akka hands-on

Setup for Java exercises that should be done before the workshop:

1. Install Java 8 (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)
2. Install Maven 2.2.1 or newer (http://maven.apache.org/)
3. Install Git (http://git-scm.com/)
4. Fetch the project: `git clone https://github.com/arild/akka-workshop.git`
4. Import project to IDE and verify there are no errors. Eclipse or IntelliJ works fine.
5. Verify that tests run: run `mvn test` from project root, or run tests via your IDE.

If you experience any problems during setup, feel free to send email to arild.nilsen (at) bekk.no and oyvind.nerbraten (at) bekk.no
